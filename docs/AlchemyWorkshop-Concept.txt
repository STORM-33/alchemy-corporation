Alchemy Corporation - Game Concept (plan max)
Core Concept
In Alchemy Corporation, you start as a humble medieval alchemist mixing basic potions in a small workshop, gradually evolving into a modern transmutation conglomerate that manipulates the fundamental elements of reality. The game balances magical traditions with industrial efficiency as you build an alchemical empire.
Game Loop
Early Game (Medieval Era)

Resource Collection: Manually gather basic ingredients (herbs, minerals, water) from your surroundings
Simple Transmutation: Combine ingredients to create basic potions and elixirs
Research: Study ancient tomes to unlock new recipes and alchemical theories
Reinvestment: Sell potions to local villagers for gold, reinvest in better equipment

Key Early Mechanics:

Different ingredients have gathering timers (herbs regrow every few minutes)
Simple crafting system with 2-3 ingredient combinations
Time-based research that continues while offline
Reputation system with local clients affects sales prices

Mid Game (Renaissance Era)

Automation: Hire apprentices to gather and craft basic potions
Laboratory Expansion: Build specialized equipment for more complex transmutations
Material Progression: Discover more valuable elements and compounds
Guild Establishment: Form an alchemists' guild to share knowledge and resources

Key Mid Mechanics:

Apprentice management system (assign tasks, train specialties)
Equipment upgrades that increase efficiency and unlock new recipes
Elemental affinity system for crafting (balance fire, water, earth, air elements)
Guild missions and contracts with nobility for special commissions

Late Game (Industrial Revolution)

Mass Production: Build factories with alchemical assembly lines
Global Network: Establish trading posts in exotic locations for rare materials
Philosopher's Stone Research: Begin multi-stage research into legendary artifacts
Competitor Management: Deal with rival alchemical corporations

Key Late Mechanics:

Production chains and supply logistics
Resource market with fluctuating prices based on global events
Long-term research projects with branching paths
Corporate espionage and sabotage protection

Endgame (Modern Era)

Reality Manipulation: Harness fundamental forces of the universe
Time Manipulation: Create time loops to optimize production
Dimensional Expansion: Access parallel worlds for exclusive resources
Ascension Path: Transform your corporation into a multidimensional entity

Key Endgame Mechanics:

Reality shards as premium currency generated by high-level transmutations
Time compression mechanics to accelerate production
Dimensional expedition system with risk/reward balancing
Multiple ascension paths with different gameplay effects

Progression Systems
Transmutation Research Tree

Potions Branch: Health potions → Transformation elixirs → Reality serums
Metallurgy Branch: Bronze transmutation → Gold creation → Exotic metals
Essence Branch: Spirit extraction → Soul binding → Consciousness transfer
Reality Branch: Local physics alterations → Weather control → Universal constants manipulation

Facility Upgrades

Workshop: Small batch production with manual operations
Laboratory: Specialized equipment for advanced formulas
Factory: Mass production with partial automation
Research Campus: Integration of theoretical and practical alchemy
Reality Forge: Manipulation of fundamental universal properties

Staff Development

Hire different specialist types (gatherers, brewers, researchers)
Training system to improve staff efficiency and unlock special abilities
Staff loyalty and satisfaction mechanics that affect production quality
Legendary alchemists that can be recruited for massive bonuses

Economic Systems
Resource Economy

Basic Resources: Herbs, minerals, animal parts (manually collected initially)
Processed Materials: Extracts, essences, compounds (crafted from basic resources)
Advanced Materials: Philosophic mercury, quintessence, void matter (requires complex processes)
Theoretical Materials: Reality fragments, time crystals, conscious matter (endgame resources)

Modern sleek facilities with glowing transmutation chambers and holographic interfaces
Endgame ethereal structures partially phased between dimensions





Simplified Alchemy Game Concept
Core Focus
Concentrate on just the early medieval alchemist experience with a clear progression path. This gives you a manageable scope with room to expand later if successful.
Streamlined Game Loop

Gather basic ingredients from a small, contained environment
Craft potions using a simple combination system
Sell potions to villagers with basic needs
Upgrade your workshop and unlock new recipes

Limited Systems to Implement

10-15 ingredients instead of dozens
20-30 potion recipes that combine 2-3 ingredients
Simple workshop with 3-4 upgradable stations
5-10 village customers with recurring needs

Progression Boundaries

Limit the game to just the "medieval era" portion of your concept
Create a clear endgame goal (like crafting a legendary potion)
Save the later eras for potential sequels or major updates

Technical Simplification

Use a single, consistent art style rather than evolving visuals
Focus on 2D rather than 3D if you're working alone
Choose a beginner-friendly engine like GameMaker, Godot, or Unity

Optional Future Expansion
If your simplified game succeeds, you could add:

The Renaissance era as your first major content update
Apprentice system as a progression mechanic
Guild features as lightweight multiplayer components

Development Approach

Build a prototype of just the gathering and crafting loop
Playtest to ensure the core mechanics are fun
Add progression systems one at a time
Polish the limited scope until it feels complete
